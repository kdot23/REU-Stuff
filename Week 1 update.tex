\frametitle{Competition and Coexistence of Two Fungal Symbionts in Beetle-Attacked Trees}

A study which examined growth and interactions between fungi of two similar species over one year

\bigskip

Found that direct competition (deadlock, combative, or replacement-type interactions) did not occur between the two species.

\bigskip

However, there was evidence of limited exploitation (indirect) competition of the two species

\bigskip

\textbf{Environment variability may promote coexistence of similar species by differentially affecting their growth rates and competitive abilities.}
